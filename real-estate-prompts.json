    "text": "Create a series of 12 engaging, laugh-out-loud email drafts for my real estate clients. Each email should open with a clever or sarcastic hook that makes them smile, include valuable info like market insights, home hacks, or local gems, and finish with a call to action that reminds them I am the only real estate agent they would ever want to work with. The tone should be humorous, a little cheeky, but still professional enough to keep Grandma subscribed. Work in lines like: I will help you sell faster than a toddler running from bedtime or Do not trust your cousin Larry just because he got his real estate license last week. For extra engagement, suggest a short, funny video idea for each month that I can link in the email.",
